<h3 id="org120b33d">Introduction</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org120b33d">
<p>
In recent years, we have  seen immense growth in e-commerce, the
products which were sold in retail businesses in the past decade
have  started  appearing  in   the  inventories  of  big  online
e-commerce  platforms.  Hence  data around  products  and  their
review in raw form of text has enlarged and the technology which
analyzes  this  large  amount  of text  is  also  evolving.  For
example, Customer reviews  which once were not  available to the
hospitality operators has been  a deciding factor in formulation
of business processes (Lui et.  al, 2015). A segment of research
is leaning toward how users  perceive the review content that is
available on the internet. As  an example, a recent survey taken
in 2021 suggests that 54% of  the user review content is trusted
by the  respondents in the  US and with  a high number  in Great
Britain (2).  However, the amount  of data that is  available on
the  internet  and  e-commerce  websites is  a  huge  amount  of
unstructured data either in terms  of customer reviews or social
media content  and it is the  most challenging task in  big data
analytics to extract information from unstructured text (Gandomi
&amp; Haider, 2015).
</p>

<p>
To understand  the customer  satisfaction and to  further extend
that  to improve  business process  and product  design process,
customer   review  analysis   can  be   exploited  as   a  vital
factor.  Previously,  Kano's  model   (Kano,  1984)  provided  a
framework  comprising five  quality  attributes  to explain  the
process  of customer  satisfaction. This  has been  exploited in
various  studies to  extract features  from textual  reviews and
have  been  improved  upon  to better  understand  the  customer
expectation from the product and hence the product features.
</p>

<p>
In this paper, we will  analyze available literature on customer
review  analysis in  respect with  product analyses.  Throughout
this paper we will touch upon  major ideas as well as approaches
used to mine  customer textual reviews and  social media content
with  various  semantic analysis  techniques  as  well as  other
machine learning algorithms.

<h3 id="org75ce5ec">Major Themes</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org75ce5ec">
<p>
The literature review revealed major themes regarding meaning in
the   textual   reviews   and  their   interpretation   by   the
reader. Various  studies used historical knowledge  on sentiment
analysis and understanding of customer psychology.
</p>

<p>
The  literature  reviewed  in  this study  showed  major  themes
related to :
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Kano model for customer satisfaction</li>
<li>Polarity in customer reviews</li>
<li>Helpfulness of Review</li>
<li>Review Quality Classification</li>

<div id="outline-container-org8412d3c" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="org8412d3c">Kano's model for customer satisfaction</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-org8412d3c">
<p>
The  studies on  product analysis  and customer  review analysis
used semantic  analysis to  mine the unstructured  text, however
most  of  these  studies  were dependent  on  Kano's  model  for
customer satisfaction  (Kano, 1984)  and its five  categories of
quality  attribute. One  such study  weighed on  five steps  for
extracting the customer satisfaction  for hotels in Korea, which
used frequency analysis and semantic analysis and then used Kano
classification  to  derive  the attributes  that  can  represent
Customer  Satisfaction Model(Lee  et.  al,  2022). Another  such
study which  applied Kano's  model for customer  satisfaction on
bicycles found  that the  lifecycle of the  product is  a potent
factor to  consider when identifying the  attributes from Kano's
model and  weighed on further  study(Lin et. al,  2017). Another
study concluded  that deriving Kano's model  categories from the
importance  of   product  or  service  was   more  effective  to
understand customer satisfaction for  Huawei P series phones.(Wu
et. al, 2018)
</p>

<div id="outline-container-org4392851" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="org4392851">Polarity in customer reviews</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-org4392851">
<p>
Customer reviews for a product  or service contains positive and
negative sentiments, and this  polarity in customer opinions for
a single  product is  a major factor  to consider  when applying
semantic analysis on customer reviews. This polarity in customer
reviews   was   most   effectively   presented   in   study   of
discriminative attributes  in the  reviews of  cosmetic products
(Kim &amp; Kang, 2018). Most of  the studies which mined the text to
arrive at what  customer wants from a  product included polarity
based attribute  classification. In one such  study, the authors
explored electronic word of  mouth(eWOM) for e-commerce products
using automatic fuzzy product ontology weighed on computation of
polarity for  more accurate results  of eWOM(Sun et.  al( 2019),
Turney  &amp; Litmman  (2003)) describe  the classification  of text
into  praise  and  criticism   using  semantic  orientation  and
semantic  association.   Similarly,  in  another  study  authors
explain how  the polarity in  customer reviews can be  viewed in
perspective of its helpfulness.  (Ahmad &amp; Laroche, 2015)
</p>

<div id="outline-container-orga186655" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="orga186655">Helpfulness of review</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-orga186655">
<p>
Analysis  of customer  reviews  only presents  one  part of  the
puzzle  as it  looks at  the customer  reviews subjectively  and
fails to provide understanding of the impact of these reviews on
readers,  hence  fails to  provide  forecasting  of the  product
sales(Lohan  et.    al,  2011).  There  have   been  studies  to
understand the impact  of the reviews on the  readers. Ahmad and
Laroche  (2015)   proposed  a  hypothesis  based   on  Cognitive
Appraisal Theory suggesting that  helpfulness of review is based
on  the  certainty  sentiment   in  the  customer  review.  They
concluded that the more the  certainty sentiment in the customer
review, the more  is to direct the reader  towards acceptance of
the  product.   In  another  study,  analyzing   the  impact  of
electronic  word  of  mouth(eWOM) from  social  media  platforms
suggest that eWOM  has a major role in  reduction of uncertainty
about  the  product  and  hence affects  purchase  decisions  of
customers(Hajli et.  al, 2014)
</p>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-orgec99204" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="orgec99204">Review of quality classification</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-orgec99204">
<p>
Similar  to helpfulness  of the  reviews, another  approach that
could be  used to classify the  reviews based on the  quality of
the reviews. By measuring the quality of the review, it provides
a  framework to  remove  them  based on  their  quality. Such  a
similar  approach can  be seen  in  the study,  the reviews  are
classified  based  on  the opinion  strength  visualization  and
ranked based on their quality  and removing low quality customer
reviews(Shamin  et. al,  2021).  They used  product features  to
develop a ranking method to evaluate customer reviews.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org7e24760" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="org7e24760">Domain Knowledge</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-org7e24760">
<p>
Most  of the  time customer  reviews  are vague  and contain  no
information about the  product, if such reviews  are credible or
not is still a question.  However, helpfulness of the review can
be  determined  from domain  knowledge  in  the customer  review
itself.  In one  such study  where  the authors  try to  improve
SA(semantic   analysis)   technique   using   Domain   Sensitive
Features(DSF), emphasizes on use of domain knowledge to evaluate
the  bag of  words(Rintyarna et.al,  2019).  Similarly,  authors
have  used   labeled  data  to  supervise   the  exploration  of
electronic word  of mouth(eWOM) in customer  reviews(Sun et. al,
2019).  Domain knowledge  is  a very  important  aspect in  such
studies where social content is evaluated for its interpretation
as  it  improves  certainty  in  readers'  minds  approving  the
certainty  hypothesis  proposed  by Ahmed  and  Laroche(Ahmad  &amp;
Laroche, 2015).
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org04a1ae6" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="org04a1ae6">Rating Framework</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-org04a1ae6">
<p>
Today  many  online  reviewing systems  provide  a  differential
rating that tells users to rate  the product or service based on
each attribute.  These multidimensional rating frameworks can be
useful to provide more  informative ratings(Chen et.  al, 2018).
Peng and  Cui provides  an approach  to understand  the customer
satisfaction  for  hotels(service)   and  beer(product)  through
correlation between different ratings  and sentiments in textual
reviews(Peng et.  al, 2019).  In  one such study, where the main
focus was  product rating,  authors reviewed  various components
other than textual review and was more product related affecting
the rating of the product(Sánchez-Pérez et. al, 2021)
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org376e5f2" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="org376e5f2">Product Lifecycle</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-org376e5f2">
<p>
Customer reviews on  products can vary over  time throughout the
lifecycle  of the  product. It  can  be an  important aspect  to
understand  the differentiation  of expectation  between service
and products(Ahmad &amp;  Laroche, 2015). A time  series analysis in
combination  with   the  I-Kano  matrix  algorithm   can  assist
analyzing change in  customer review attribute over  a period of
time(Lee et. al, 2022). Lin  and Tsai also suggest more research
towards the impact of product  lifecycle on customer reviews and
ratings(Lin et. al, 2017)
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-orge9668ce" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="orge9668ce">Preference of risk</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-orge9668ce">
<p>
Kano's model  on customer  satisfaction suggests that  there are
three basic principles of loss  and gain(Lin et. al, 2017) which
are very  critical to  understand the customer's  preference for
risk  taking.These principles  explain  the customer's  attitude
towards loss and gain regarding  the product features, which can
be  used to  interpret the  customer  review in  respect to  the
reader and forecast the impact on product sale.
</p>

<p>
There are  other approaches to  study the product  analysis that
have been touched  upon in this literature  review, however they
are  important in  respect  of  product launch  as  well as  the
marketing associated  with it.  In study  analyzing twitter data
in respect to the launch of Apple and Samsung products, proposes
a social network analysis  focusing on the conversation analysis
to understand the electronic word of mouth(eWOM)(Lipizzi et. al,
2015). As  noted in one  study (Albayrak &amp; Caber,  2013) product
performance  and customer  satisfaction  has  an asymmetric  and
non-linear  relationship and  can  be a  potential aspect  while
evaluating performance  of the product based  on online customer
reviews(OCR). Reviews  are classified based on  the structure of
the  content  in three  different  categories:  short, long  and
unstructured (Haddara et. al, 2020).
</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org87c9eba" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="org87c9eba">Analysis Approaches Used</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org87c9eba">
<p>
Product  analysis  based  on  customer review  analysis  can  be
divided into  two different steps: mining  the unstructured text
to either  produce a bag of  words or extract sentiments  of the
customer reviews. And  then use the output of the  first step to
evaluate  the  review  using  different  analytics  and  machine
learning techniques to produce results that can be understood.
</p>

<p>
Most  of  the studies  done  in  the  past on  customer  reviews
analysis  have used  Latent  Semantic  Analysis(LSA) and  Latent
Dirichlet Allocation(LDA).   For example, Kim and  Kang used LSA
and  LDA  to  extract discriminative  attributes  from  cosmetic
products(Kim &amp; Kang, 2018).  Similarly, in a study of the impact
of social media  on electronic word of  mouth(eWOM), the authors
used Singular Value Decomposition(SVD)  algorithm in addition to
LSA to extract SVD  factors from the twitter conversations(Ahmad
&amp; Laroche,  2015). While  in study  by Xu  and Wang  uses Linear
Regression Model to work upon features computed from the textual
reviews by LSA(Xu et. al, 2017).
</p>

<p>
In some studies  of customer review analysis,  authors have used
more fine grained  steps that ranged from three to  five to come
to the end result.  Lee, Park and Kwak proposed five steps which
included  two steps  of  Kano classification  and I-Kano  matrix
analysis to extract kano attributes from textual reviews(Lee et.
al, 2022).  Ban &amp; Kim  (2019) analyzed airlines customer reviews
data by  introducing Machine Learning framework  to evaluate the
features extracted from Frequency  analysis and Semantic Network
Analysis.  In one study of  Amazon product reviews, authors used
supervised  Machine  Learning   algorithm  with  labeled  domain
knowledge after semantic analysis  to ingest credibility aspects
of customer reviews into the text mining(Rintyarna et.al, 2019).
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org9b1d529" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="org9b1d529">Findings</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org9b1d529">
<p>
Finding  meaning  in  the  unstructured  textual  reviews  is  a
challenging task and various aspects like Kano Model (Lee et. al
, 2022, Wu  et. al, 2018) polarity in customer  reviews (Ahmad &amp;
Laroche,  2015), Kano  model (Hajli  et. al  , 2014)  Quality of
reviews  (Shamin  et. al,  2021)  has  been  used to  provide  a
direction for understanding the meaning in textual reviews. Some
exploration  in social  conversations(Hajli et.   al, 2014)  and
social  media  content(Sun et.   al,  2019)  proposed models  to
understand the impact of social media trends and conversation to
determine the sales of the product after its initial launch.
</p>

<p>
However, semantic analysis is a  major technique that is used in
customer  review analysis  as  well as  various other  important
aspects affecting the product analysis, various other techniques
(as shown in Rintyarna et.al  2019)are placed on top to evaluate
the process behind customer  review analysis and product feature
analysis.
</p>

<p>
The previous work in the  analysis of customer reviews and other
aspects of the product  analysis reported few problems regarding
chronological nature of  customer reviews and its  impact to the
product lifecycle as major problems to incorporate with semantic
analysis.(Lin  et.   al, 2017)  Shimi  Naurin  Ahmad and  Michel
Laroche advocates  future research on comparison  of service and
product reviews  and how  intangible aspects of  service affects
the content of the reviews (Ahmad &amp; Laroche, 2015)
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org991859c" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="org991859c">Gaps in Literature</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org991859c">
<p>
Throughout this section, we will  discuss the literature gap and
possible direction of further study to understand the product or
service in  accordance with customer satisfaction.  We will also
touch upon  various aspects  of customer satisfaction  which are
more related  to organizations business processes  regarding the
development  of   certain  products.  Below  are   the  research
questions that's needed to  study to understand the relationship
between    customer   reviews,    customer   satisfaction    and
product/service sale.
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Does the  intangible nature of service affect  the content of
the  customer  reviews  resulting in  positive  and  negative
sentiments?</li>

<li>How the  lifecycle of  the product  can affect  the customer
reviews and satisfaction based on  it's timespan or launch of
new product?</li>
<li>Can  a digital campaign  on social media affect  the customer
reviews positively or negatively?</li>
<li>Can a  service which  is  supportive to  a product  increase
customer  satisfaction  beyond  its  correlation  to  product
performance?</li>
</ol>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org9f71cf1" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="org9f71cf1">Difference between reviews of product and service</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-org9f71cf1">
<p>
As suggested in a study by  Ahmed and Laroche, there needs to be
further  study in  the  area of  difference  between reviews  of
product  and   service(Ahmad  &amp;   Laroche,  2015).    There  are
possibilities of  difference in customer satisfaction  towards a
product   and  service   due   to  the   intangible  nature   of
service. Furthermore,  customer reviews  on service needs  to be
supported by  the evidence of transcripts  between customers and
service  support  systems.   Similar  to the  impact  of  social
electronic word of mouth on reduction of certainty(Hajli et. al,
2014),  the impact  of transcripts  can be  evaluated to  better
understand the  customer satisfaction of  service. Additionally,
customer opinions  for services  tend to  be more  detailed when
classified  as negative,  however  it needs  to  be verified  to
understand the difference of  opinion mining between product and
service.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-orgee66bd6" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="orgee66bd6">Customer satisfaction through the life cycle of the product</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-orgee66bd6">
<p>
Product life  cycle can vary from  days to years, for  example a
food  product is  consumed on  daily  or weekly  basis while  an
automobile product can survive up  to decade.  To understand the
customer satisfaction this  very aspect of the  product needs to
be incorporated in the framework of customer review analysis. We
can see  such evidence(Lee et.   al, 2022), where  I-Kano Matric
can be  used to incorporate additional  variables like longevity
of the product.   Products which are having  shorter life cycles
can incorporate direct  performance-importance(Wu et.  al, 2018)
models to improve customer  satisfaction.  Similar kind of study
needs to  be done  having a  longer life  cycle, to  improve the
product  design processes  that can  take continuous  evaluation
from customer review mining.

<div id="outline-container-org3fe9688" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="org3fe9688">Correlation between digital marketing and its reflection in customer reviews.</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-org3fe9688">
<p>
There  is  indeed an  impact  of  social  media content  on  the
interpretation  of   customer  reviews   as  it   can  propagate
electronic word  of mouth  which can be  critical to  remove the
uncertainty in readers mind.(Hajli  et. al, 2014) However, there
is a possibility of similar  negative kind of propagation in the
social media content either by rival company or some loyalist of
the company, that  has nothing to do with  the product features.
There is evidence that just  as customer behavior reinforces the
market, the market also can reinforce the customer behavior(Wood
&amp; Burchell, 2018).  How this  kind of negative - electronic word
of mouth impacts the mind of the reader while reviewing customer
reviews.  Such  study needs to  address also the  possibility of
similar negative  reviews that have  nothing to do  with product
features or performance.

<div id="outline-container-org555921f" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="org555921f">Analysis of reviews of service related to product</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-org555921f">
<p>
Most of the studies have  either touched upon the service sector
as in hotel services ((Lee et. al (2022) and Ban &amp; Kim ,2018) or
product sector  as in  cosmetic products(Haddara et.   al, 2020)
and  amazon product(–)  as focus  of customer  satisfaction and
opinion   mining.    However,   to   understand   the   customer
satisfaction through customer relation, we need to further study
on products and services that are interrelated, and how customer
satisfaction and customer reviews of these services and products
correlates to  each other.   There needs to  be research  in the
area  of  customer and  service  support  transcripts to  better
understand the  credibility of  the customer reviews  and direct
the product and service based decision with more accuracy.

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org3d880fc">
<p>
Customer satisfaction  and customer review analysis  can be seen
as a  bilateral process to  improve the  product as well  as the
business  processes  developing  the products(Wood  &amp;  Burchell,
2018). Customer satisfaction and customer review analysis can be
an automated  process through which an  organization can improve
customer relations and  listen to the preferences  and peeves of
customers to  design better  products and  services.  Sentiments
found in the trends of social media are not enough to understand
a customer's  needs(Lipizzi et.  al,  2015) and in the  new era,
where there is a realm of  products which needs to be customized
as per customer  segments needs further development  in the area
of  customer  preference and  satisfaction  in  addition to  the
trends in social media.

<h4 id="org6905af5">Practical Implications</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-org6905af5">
<p>
This study shows how different  aspects of customer reviews have
been  used to  analyze the  product or  service as  well as  the
perspective of the end user of the product or service. Evolution
in  the  business  process  previously has  been  based  on  the
empirical  evidence  of how  a  product/service  should be  best
designed. Development  of new  products and  services is  a very
important  process  for  an  organization  in  this  competitive
age(Golder &amp; Mitra, 2018). However, disposal of huge data around
the perception of end users about products and services provided
by  an organization  or company  is the  most vital  aspect when
designing business processes that are suited to deliver the best
products objectively and not subjectively. Hence, development of
new product as well as service
</p>

<p>
In  today's market,  competition for  a single  product needs  a
customer  first  perspective  at  the  implementation  phase  of
product design.  Customer perspective  can be best understood by
different  techniques  shown  in   this  study.   The  practical
application  of  effective  product  analysis  can  improve  the
already  known business  process and  product design  process as
well as infer an higher level of product delivery framework that
can encourage involvement of customers more.

<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-org987799f">
<p>
In theory,  the product analysis  based on customer  reviews can
also  help understand  the  trends of  emotions running  through

This study involved  review of literature of the  past decade on
customer  reviews   and  product  analysis  based   on  customer
satisfaction.   The  literature   used  various   techniques  of
sentiment analysis, latent semantic  analysis as well as machine
learning algorithm  to find meaning  in the textual  reviews and
social media content about certain  products in order to provide
better customer satisfaction and product design process. Current
research  has been  based  on various  psychological models  for
customer  satisfaction   like  the  Kano  model   and  emotional
hypothesis on  interpretation of customer reviews.  The research
has provided understanding of impact of customer review analysis
on customer satisfaction and product design processes.

<p>
In this  literature review,  There is limitation  as it  has not
involved business processes that  are attached to product design
and its analysis.  To execute  both product design processes and
product analysis  in coherence the product  design processes are
further needed to study within  the iota of product analysis. As
discussed above there  is scope for research  in accordance with
comparison  of  product  and  service  review  analysis  and  it
requires  thorough   analysis  to   understand  the   impact  of
intangible  nature  of  the  services on  customer  reviews  and
electronic  word of  mouth(eWOM).  To understand  the impact  of
customer  reviews on  product sales  there needs  to be  further
research  where customer  reviews on  two different  versions of
product  and similar  product from  two different  companies are
analyzed and  mined for  customer satisfaction  evaluation. This
literature  review  is  limited  in the  sense  of  analysis  of
literature available  on customer review analysis  in accordance
with product  analysis as  it only  reviews literature  from the
past decade.
